# bbva-accessibility-team

This is a project built for the Hackathon BBVA 2022

We replicated the web page of BBVA, adding a chatbot in the credit card section. Also, we implemented a system to save the user's register to be able to contact the users who did not complete the process immediately.

We use technologies like PHP, CSS, SQL database hosted in AWS RDS, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Landbot and Power BI.
